# The Movie Review Application

This is a social media web application to share review on movies 
developed using react, material, and firebase by [@easa](https://github.com/easa). 
Thanks to Robin Wieruch [@rwieruch](https://github.com/rwieruch) for his beautiful [tutorial on react/firebase](https://www.robinwieruch.de/complete-firebase-authentication-react-tutorial). This project is different from the orginal article by using react hooks instead of class components.  
These tech are used in this project: __react context, react hooks, firebase, material css__.  
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  

> feel free to use this project and if you wanted more information feel free to ask.
